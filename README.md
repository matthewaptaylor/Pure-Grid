# Pure-Grid
A simple, bootstrap-like responsive grid system.

Encase '.col' divs in "&lt;div class='container'&rt;".

'.col' divs must have the class '.col' and a size value.

Each row has 12 columns.

'.col-1' makes the element 1/12 of the container's width.
'.col-sm-2' makes the element 2/12 of the container's width when the screen is 576 pixels wide or more.
'.col-md-3' makes the element 3/12 of the container's width when the screen is 768 pixels wide or more.
'.col-lg-4' makes the element 4/12 of the container's width when the screen is 992 pixels wide or more.
'.col-lg-5' makes the element 5/12 of the container's width when the screen is 1200 pixels wide or more.

A column the width of the entire container would be represented by '<div class="col col-12"></div>'.
