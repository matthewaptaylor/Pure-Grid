# PureGrid.css
<p>
  A simple, bootstrap-like responsive grid system.
</p>
<p>
  Encase '.col' divs in "&lt;div class='container'&gt;".
</p>
<p>
  '.col' divs must have the class '.col' and a size value.
</p>
<p>
  Each row has 12 columns.
</p>
<p>
  '.col-1' makes the element 1/12 of the container's width.<br>
  '.col-sm-2' makes the element 2/12 of the container's width when the screen is 576 pixels wide or more.<br>
  '.col-md-3' makes the element 3/12 of the container's width when the screen is 768 pixels wide or more.<br>
  '.col-lg-4' makes the element 4/12 of the container's width when the screen is 992 pixels wide or more.<br>
  '.col-lg-5' makes the element 5/12 of the container's width when the screen is 1200 pixels wide or more.
</p>
<p>
  A column the width of the entire container would be represented by '&lt;div class="col col-12"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;'.
